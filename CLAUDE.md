# CLAUDE

You MUST dogfood your own code using Task.  Task runs everything. you MUST test everything.

You MUST not just assume things work but run things using Task.

You MUST use GOWORK=off, so you do no need a go.work. again modelled in task file.

You MUST use the Decksh test repos.  use the .src folder for this.

you MUST NOT take shortcuts.

.bin is used for binaires.
.src is used for source.
